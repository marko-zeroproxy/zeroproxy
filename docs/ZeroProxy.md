## Project Overview
[ZeroProxy.io](https://zeroproxy.io) is creating a better platform for
the creation, trade, and settlement of financial derivatives. 

Great progress has been made recently with bringing derivitaves onto
the blockchain, but current state of the art largely replicates the
problems of the legacy finaical system, resulting in centralized
exchanges with significant counterparty and settlement risk.

We are fixing these problems with a new approach that enables native
collateralization, transparent on-chain hypothecation, and the
financialization of any asset, on-chain or off, including NFTs. 

This solution is powered by the ZeroChain, an EVM-based, permissioned
blockchain designed for high-security asset bridging and the creation
and trading of financial derivatives.

## The Problem to Solve

DeFi was created to democratize finance and solve the problems of the
centralized, legacy financial system. Financial derivtaives, taken in
aggregate, represent the largest financial market on earth, and also
one of the least transparent. 

Approximately 2,000 Trillion USD of derivatives are traded every year,
a notional value so large as to represent a 25x multiplier on global
GDP. Most of these derivatives are centrally traded, with large
counterparty risk and little transparency. This opacity and
centralization have alrady led to massive market failures and crises,
the 2008 finaical crisis and the 2022 crypto meltdown being only two
recent examples.
