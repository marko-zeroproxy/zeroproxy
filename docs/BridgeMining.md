## Problem to Solve

Bridges between blockchains are essential to the operation of many important and useful blockchain protocols. However, the problem of securely bridging between blockchains remains an open problem, as evidenced by the large number and high value of recent bridge attack exploits. Since mature blockchain L1s are rarely the subject of successful chain-level attacks, why do bridges remain vulnerable?

This is because while blockchain protocols provide relatively strong security and consistency guarantees, connections between blockchains necessarily exist outside such guarantees, and present low-redundancy failure modes, in some cases requiring only the compromise of a single signer.

In this paper we outline a solution for secure bridging in which the challenge of attacking a bridge scales in difficulty with the challenge of attacking the integrity of an L1 chain.

### What is a bridge?

A bridge is a mechanism by which a state change on one blockchain can be reflected onto another. For example, the Bitcoin network has a number of desirable properties in terms of security, decentralization, and scale. However, the Bitcoin network has technical limitations that make implementing certain types of DApps difficult. Ethereum, by contrast, more gracefully supports a wider range of smart contracts, though ETH has historically not been considered as robust a store of value as BTC. If it were possible to "move" BTC onto Ethereum, one could in principle have the best of both worlds. How would this be possible?

With a small amount of thought, an answer presents itself. Some quantity of BTC is transferred to a bitcoin wallet address that is controlled by an escrow mechanism, locking this BTC. At the same time, a proxy asset such as "[wrapped bitcoin](https://wbtc.network/)" is issued on the Ethereum network as an ERC20 token. Since the proxy asset corresponds 1:1 to the original asset, and can be converted back to the original through a burning/unlocking process, a strong argument can be made for the value of the proxy asset being the same as the original.

### Why do bridges present security risks?

However robust and secure the original Bitcoin network might be, and however robust and secure the Ethereum network might be, the fact remains that the bridge depends upon an escrow mechanism exists outside both blockchains, and presents a single point of failure. Worse, the amount of value at risk isn't limited to the value of the asset locked in escrow, since a successful attack could result in arbitrarily large amounts of proxy asset being issued and converted to other forms of value before the exploit might be discovered. This type of attack has been successfully conducted many times across many protocols. (drop in some citations)

## How can we implement bridges with security guarantees?

Given that bridges are essential to the operation of a wide range of DeFi protocols and are unlikely to go away any time soon, how can we implement bridging in a secure way? Let's consider a set of bridge implementations that build on each other in terms of security guarantees.

### Naive Implementation

The naive implementation of a bridge is a deterministic algorithm that observes the state of both blockchains and operates with sufficient credentials to unilaterally perform all necessary bridging operations. This algorithm must have signing authority over both the escrow contract on the "sending" side of the bridge and the minting/burning contract on the receiving side of the bridge. Thus, this algorithm must constantly have access to private keys that, if compromised, could lead to arbitrary bridge exploits.

Since this is the naive implementation, not a broken implementation, we assume that this algorithm is implemented correctly and, for a given set of inputs, will always perform the correct state change operations. So what could possibly go wrong? Lots.

Any real embodiment of this bridge requires a network-connected server or container performing RPC calls to two separate blockchains, perhaps a Node.js script running in an Alpine Linux docker container in AWS or Google Cloud. The physical and network security of this container is only as good as the security of the underlying hardware, data center, container orchestration system, operating system kernel, and the hundreds of Node.js packages upon which it depends. Even if the bridge code itself were provably correct, the likelihood that the underlying tech stack presents numerous zero-day vulnerabilities approaches certainty. And what about exploits relating to hardware access?

But it isn't simply exploits we have to worry about. Presumably somebody has control over this container, and some other persons have control over the server and data center. Whoever is involved might be subject to extortion or millions of dollars in bribes. Or maybe they just want to drain the bridge themselves â€” you won't find out till it's all converted to Monero and they are on the plane to Bermuda.

By placing this bridge and all relevant personnel at the center of an intensive, paranoid, defense-in-depth security system, we might have some security assurances, but at what cost, and for how long?

### Adding Human Oversight and Redundancy

If a naive algorithmic bridge presents a high risk of exploit, the logical response is to add human oversight and redundancy. In the simplest version, we create an escrow mechanism and minting/burning contract that require multiple, independent approvals before new assets are issued or redeemed. These approvals require signing with separate credentials, which are stored separately and kept offline except for signing operations. Conceptually, this could be implemented as a human bridge committee DAO, perhaps meeting once per day, in which the signatures of a quorum of human signers would have to approve the requested bridging operations of the previous 24 hours.

Obviously, such a solution would introduce tremendous latency but would make credential stealing attacks more difficult. And if implemented correctly, successful exploitation would require credential theft from or the bribery/extortion of multiple members of the approval group, representing a significantly higher bar.

Unfortunately, experience shows that having a committee in charge of a bridge or protocol doesn't defend against one of the most likely threat scenarios, in which a quorum of the committee colludes to steal the assets. Thus, this is simply yet another massive rug-pull waiting to happen. And as the value of the bridged assets grows, so will grow the temptation. And in the long run, a group of patient attackers could infiltrate the bridge committee DAO, perhaps waiting years for their chance.

While redundancy and human oversight might help mitigate some risks, the effective concentration of decision making still presents significant long-term risks, especially as the value of the target grows.

So maybe adding human oversight doesn't solve much of the problem. But what if we added more redundancy? Lots more?

## Proposed Solution: Bridge Mining

We propose a solution to the bridging problem that has the security properties of an L1, namely that a successful exploit would require the compromise of multiple, independent, and heterogeneous nodes, and in which the security of the bridging system grows proportionally with the number of nodes that are added.

### A blockchain for bridging... and maybe for other things, too ðŸ˜‰

What we are proposing is a bridging blockchain, which is to say a new L1 chain that provides strong redundancy for secure bridging and acts as the hub in a hub-and-spoke bridging network. This chain can be used for much more than bridging â€” in fact, we propose to use this chain as a hub for a wide range of cross-chain applications, notably financial derivatives â€” but such a chain could create tremendous value as the universal L2 and bridge between all public blockchains.

#### Bridging Architecture: Hub-and-spoke vs n^2

Right now, bridges are generally an ad-hoc affair. If a bridge is necessary between chain **A** and chain **B**, that specific bridge is created. Bridging every chain to every other chain quickly leads to an **n**^2 explosion in the number of bridges, a massive risk in and of itself. A much better network topology is hub-and-spoke, where if there are **n** asset chains there are precisely **n** bridges.

**Insert hub-and-spoke vs n^2 diagram here**

#### Bridge Chain Node Architecture

We envision a new L1 (almost certainly based on the time-tested EVM/Geth stack, though a Jupiter/Cosmos implementation or some other bespoke implementation is conceivable as well) in which each node in the chain is actually a tightly integrated cluster of nodes: One "full" bridge-mining node and one or more lightweight or full nodes for each supported asset bridging chain. An example cluster is shown below:

**insert diagram of ZeroChain (bridge mining) node with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain nodes**

This node cluster is deployed as a single container or tightly orchestrated set of containers with the **Bridge Control Script** (likely a Node.js or Python script) receiving events from each node and interacting with appropriate smart contracts on all nodes.

The Bridge Control Script will receive an event each time a new block is issued on the bridge mining L1. At that point, the script will determine whether it is participating in validation, as described below.

#### Distributed, unpredictable bridge transaction validation

Just as miners compete to add the next block to a conventional proof-of-work blockchain, in bridge mining each mining node would cooperate to validate bridging transactions. The algorithm is as follows:

For each new block on the blockchain:

* Each bridge mining node will "roll the dice" (see psuedocode below) to determine if it is self-nominating to participate in bridge validation. The result of the roll can be one of three states: no action, transaction verification, or transaction finalization.
  * In the `no action` state, the node does not participate in validation for this block. For blockchiains with more than a small number of bridge mining nodes, this is the most likely outcome.
  * In the `transaction verification` state, the node reviews all unexpired, unfinalized bridging requests older than the `confirmation threshold`, say five blocks. (requests younger than the threshold are considered to be provisional, and may be subject to a block reorganization). A `bridging request` is a smart-contract transaction requesting to bridge an asset on to, or off of, the bridging chain. Each bridging request can be identified by a unique transaction hash.

    For each new or unfinalized bridging request older than the `confirmation threshold`\:
    * If the request is older than the `expiration threshold`, say ten blocks, the request is expired and will be ignored. Assets that have been temporarily locked in escrow will be unlocked and available for withdrawal.
    * If the request is not expired and appears to be properly constructed and authorized based on on-chain state, the node marks the request as provisionally confirmed and posts a `confirmation message` on the corresponding chain. Several such provisional confirmations and `confirmation message` may have already been posted, or will be posted by other nodes this block or in future blocks.
    * If a request is not expired but does not appear to be properly constructed/authorized, no action is taken, though a log event may be generated
  * In the `transaction finalization` state, the node reviews all unexpired, confirmed bridging transactions. For each confirmation that appears valid, it increments a counter associated with the underlying bridging request. If the counter exceeds a `verification threshold`, the node invokes the underlying smart-contract method for the bridging operation, citing the hashes of the valid confirmations.
    * increment a confirmation counter for the confirmed transaction's bridging request
  *
