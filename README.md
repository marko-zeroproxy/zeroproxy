## Project Overview
[ZeroProxy.io](https://zeroproxy.io) is creating a better platform for
the creation, trade, and settlement of financial derivatives. 

Great progress has been made recently with bringing derivatives onto
the blockchain, but current state of the art largely replicates the
problems of the legacy financial system, resulting in centralized
exchanges with significant counterparty and settlement risk.

We are fixing these problems with a new approach that enables native
collateralization, transparent on-chain hypothecation, and the
financialization of any asset, on-chain or off, including NFTs. 

This solution is powered by the ZeroChain, an EVM-based, permissioned
blockchain designed for high-security asset bridging and the creation
and trading of financial derivatives.
